# AngularJS 
## Introduction  
AngularJS is a Javascript open-source front-end structural framework that is mainly used to develop single-page web applications(SPAs).
## Why to use?
* Easy to work with
* Time Saving
* Ready to use templates
* Directives: Hlps to create reusable components for the app
## Key features
### Model View Controller
* Model:  consists of database and & resposnsible for managing data.
* View: displaying application data to users
* Controller: this helps in communication between Model & view component 
### Data Model Binding 
It is a Two-Way process i.e. the layer of MVC architecture is an exact copy of the model layer.
### Templates
The main advantage of using AngularJS is how it makes use of the templates. Normally what happens is that the templates are passed by the browser into DOM, then DOM becomes the input of the AngularJS compiler and then AngularJS traverses the DOM template for rendering instructions which are called directives.
### Unit Testing Ready
Testing framework "Karma" helps in designing unit tests for AngularJS apps.
### Intgration & Extensibility
Easy integration with other libraries and frameworks. Creating custom directives \, filters and services giving the flexibility to tailor the framework to your specific needs.
## Benefits of AngularJS
### Depending Injection
Dependency Injection is a software design pattern. It works on the basis of Inversion of Control. Inversion control means objects do not create other objects. Instead, they get these objects from an outside source.
## Pros of AnglarJS
* It facilitates the Two-way Binding that helps to render correspondingly the changes made to the view or the model.
* It helps to create a responsive web application, along with providing the prototyping that can be utilized to load the application faster.
*It uses the concept of directive that helps to add functionality to the application. For this, the overall length of the code reduces along with discarding the repetition of the code that is specific to perform the particular task.

## Cons of AngularJS 
* As this framework belongs to Javascript, so it is required to have prior knowledge of Javascript.
* If new to this framework, then debugging the scope can be a difficult task.
